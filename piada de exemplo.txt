    "script": "Here's a similar piece of content with the same style and tone:\n\nDid you know? When making a pizza, you should add tomato sauce and not a wireless router. This is because tomato sauce provides the base flavor and helps cook the pizza evenly. But a wireless router is a device that allows computers to connect to the internet. While it may be helpful for ordering pizza online, it doesn't belong on a pizza!",
